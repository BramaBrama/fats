FATS - FATS a Twisted Fast Asterisk's Telephony Services.

Twisted framework based enhancement. Project contains protocols implementation for 
the FastAGI and AMI. Allow to make your Asterisk IP-PBX server faster and easy to use.

1) FastAGI protocol - Fast Asterisk Gateway Interface based on the Twisted framework 
   allow you develop dial plan scripts like a network service. 
   Clear dial plan logic and unload processor from a hard weight AGI processes.

2) AMI - Asterisk Management Interface. You can create fast and
   asynchronous application with gtk2, xml-rpc or web2 based interface 
   for the Asterisk management. Enjoy!

3) Auto test tools. Project contains unit tests and API for easy testing of a custom FATS services. 
   MockAsterisk and MockDatabase technique allow you develop and debug\test difficult 
   FastAGIAMI services without real Asterisk IP-PBX server or database.
